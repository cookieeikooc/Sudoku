# Sudoku
This is my Final Project of “Introduction to Computers and Programming”. Fall 2024

## Notice
- This code is specifically made for macOS and macOS Terminal, and may not be able to run under other unix-like operating system.
- This code is not a Sudoku solver. It generates Sudoku templates which have THE ONLY SOLUTION.
- You need to install ncurses on your computer to be able to compile the entire code.
